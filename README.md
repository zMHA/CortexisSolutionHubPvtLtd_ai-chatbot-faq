📘 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to automatically handle customer queries about a business — including details about its products, services, pricing, working hours, and policies.
It acts as a 24/7 intelligent support agent, delivering instant responses and improving user experience without human involvement.

⚙️ How It Works

The chatbot uses Gradio to provide an easy and interactive web interface.

User messages are processed through a trained NLP model that understands context and intent.

The model retrieves or generates accurate answers based on the company’s predefined FAQs.

Users receive instant, natural-language responses — just like chatting with a real support agent.
